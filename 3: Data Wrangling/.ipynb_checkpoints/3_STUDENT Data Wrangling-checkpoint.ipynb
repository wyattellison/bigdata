    "Many times, in order to get a dataset, you'll have to look online.  Some web sites are great and offer customizable data that can be downloaded as an CSV.  Yes!  Many, many others are not so great.  They'll have a chart on a page, but with lots of clutter and no way to download it.  And even if you do manage to download it, you sometimes have to work on the data to get it into a form that you can use.  This is affectionately called data wrangling.\n",

    "# GOOD OL' COPY AND PASTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into anything more complicated, the first thing you should always try is a simple copy and paste.  Copy the chart and paste it into a spreadsheet app.  You never know; it just might work.\n",

    "\n",
    "But in order for Beautiful Soup to do its job, it needs to know which part of the web site you want to pull data from.  If you already know HTML, this will make a lot of sense to you.  If you don't, I'll try to explain along the way.  Come on!\n",

They have so much bloat that it's shocking.  Go to some web page you like and view the source, just so you get a sense of what I'm talking about.\n",

    "Using developer tools sometimes works great, but sometimes it doesn't because it's hard to find what you're looking for.\n",

    "\n",
    "Go to one of the following pages (depending on if you're interested in world population, olympic medal counts, top movies of all time, or silver prices over time), look at the chart, and then try the inspect element trick to see where the data table is in the HTML:\n",

    "Once the developer tools are open, look at the top panel.  This is the HTML.  Scroll around to see how the chart data is laid out in HTML.  Notice that as you move the cursor in the developer window, elements on the web page get highlighted.  Try to identify the table with an id or a name tag.  If the table has neither, you can just find all tables on the page and then check if it's the table you want.\n",

      "The 1900 Summer Olympics were held in Paris, France, from May 14 to October 28, 1900, as part of the 1900 World's Fair. A total of 997 athletes representing 24 nations participated in 95 events in 19 sports at these games.[1] Women competed in the Olympics for the first time during the 1900 games.[2] 21 of the 24 participating nations earned medals, in addition to 12 medals won by teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The host nation of France flooded the field, comprising over 72% of all the athletes (720 of the 997); given that, America dominated athletically, winning the second-most gold (19), silver (14), and bronze (14) medals, while fielding fewer than 8% of the athletes (75 of 997).[2]\n",
      "In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations.[3] Retroactively, the IOC created the designation Mixed team (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these groups of athletes. During the 1900 games, athletes participating in mixed teams won medals in athletics, polo, rowing, sailing, tennis, and tug of war. \n",
      "Gold medals were not given at the 1900 Games; a silver medal was given for a first place and a bronze medal was given for second.  The International Olympic Committee has retroactively assigned gold, silver, and bronze medals to competitors who earned first, second, and third-place finishes respectively in order to bring early Olympics in line with current awards.[4]\n",

NOCs: 24 Athletes: 997 (22 women, 975 men) Events: 95 The IOC page,  \"Paris 1900\", affirms a total of 95 medal events, which has been the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding events that should be considered \"Olympic\". The previous IOC database contained at least ten fewer events. The IOC has never made any decision on which events are Olympic and which are not. In 2016, the IOC obtained the rights to the  OlyMADMen database (at Olympedia.org – the source of the sports-reference.com data), which was created and maintained by Bill Mallon. IOC substituted the OlyMADMen data for the earliest Olympics. See Mallon, Bill (August 16, 2016). \"The OlyMADMen and OlympStats and Sports-Reference\". We have more data and stats and expertise on the Olympics than any similar group. We have far more than what can be found in Wikipedia, just for starters. You may know of the www.sports-reference.com/olympics site (SR/olympics), which is very good, but that is actually also our site ... We have completed discussions with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to have them use www.olympedia.org as part of their Olympic Statistical Database. Because of this, the SR/olympics site will eventually mostly close down.\n",
