# Big Data

Welcome to Mr. Manzo's Big Data class. Here you can find all the Jupyter Notebooks associated with the class. In order to run these notebooks, you'll need to do a few things.

First you need to install Python 3, for which the download link can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have a stable version of Python 3 (not 2.7!) installed, follow these steps to install pip, numpy, and jupyter notebook:

1) open terminal after installing python 3
2) into terminal>> python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
3) into terminal>> python3 -m pip install jupyter
4) into terminal>> python3 -m pip install numpy

Now everything should be installed (for now...), so here's how to launch Jupyter Notebook every time you want to get to work!
1) open terminal
2) open a finder window and go to the Big Data folder downloaded from github
3) type "cd " into terminal (c, d, then space)
4) drag and drop the Big Data folder into the terminal window from finder (the file path should appear)
5) into terminal>> jupyter notebook
6) option-c in the terminal window to shut down jupyter

Have fun! -W
