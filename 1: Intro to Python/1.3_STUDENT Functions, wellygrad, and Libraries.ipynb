    "# FUNCTIONS\n",

    "Functions are very important in coding, since they allow you to define a process that can be repeated any number of times. We've already used a few of them, like ```range()``` or ```str()```. In a way, functions are a kind of variable whose definition is more code. (Really they're objects in Python, just like variables and classes). Here's how you might define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_function(integer_input):\n",
    "    return integer_input*2\n",
    "    \n",
    "my_function(4) #equals 8\n",
    "my_function(0) #equals 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "All ```my_function``` does is return the input value times 2. Great. ```my_function``` is as smart as a second grader. What else can we do? \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take any sort of input, and any number of inputs. They don't necessarily have to return anything, but if you don't want them to you have to put ```return None``` to specify that. What's great about functions in Python is you don't have to define the variable type you want to input or output. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def add(input1, input2):\n",
    "    return(input1 + input2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "add(\"hello \",\"world!\") #returns \"hello world!\"\n",
    "add(4, 5) #returns 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "The ```add``` function is really just the ```+``` operator, but you can see that it can take either a string or an integer (or other numbers) and concatenate them or add them together depending on the inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of using Jupyter Notebook is it's pretty easy for me to use an autograder on your functions. I've written a library of functions that take your functions as inputs and put them through a variety of tests to make sure they're working properly! So from here on out, you might be asked to define functions and then pass them to my grader. Here's some examples of what I mean:"

    "It's important to understand functions, since the primary advantage of Python is that there are loads of libraries out there that have their own functions that you'll want to use. If you can write your own functions, you shuld be able to understand how to use them. Conversely, if you understand how others' functions work, you'll be better at writing your own functions.\n",
    "# LIBRARIES\n",
    "One of the truly amazing things about python is the huge number of very useful and practical libraries that are available.  They are the heart and soul of python.  And all you have to do is write one line of code to import a library...\n",

    "\n",

Well, for math this is sort of pointless, but for libraries with longer names, it can be a pain to type out their entire name.  This allows you to use a nickname to refer to the library and access its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the function ```sqrt()``` is part of the math library, and it takes the square root of a number.  I could access this function in a couple of ways...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "answer = math.sqrt(x)\t\t# if I just imported the math library\n",

    "\n",
    "print ('the square root of ' + str(x) + ' is ' + str(answer) )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already used one library a little bit earlier: wellygrad! That's a pretty simple one that just acts as an autograder, so Manzo doesn't have to read through your functions to see if your code is spaghetti. This way, you'll know immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be using a number of libraries and each will be explained as we come to them, but one of the key libraries (numpy, which is my favorite and simply amazing) will be discussed in the next notebook.\n"
